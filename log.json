Although some are fairly at a good price, several are shockingly at a higher cost than expected. To keep Wish more reliable like other organizations, it's recommended to have a trusting connection with the customers and end up creating satisfying results. Another thing that needs to be confirmed is this app should be verified to be safe and keep contents all real. Well, that's what I think for certain products that are recommended or are on the wishlist. Overall, my experience with Wish had slightly increased my interest in it, to a rate of 3 to 5 from 2 to 5 from the beginning. I feel some trustworthiness in the products I just confirmed paying for. :-)   Full Review"},{"author":"","date":"September 13, 2017","score":"","text":"My aunt ordered my sister some $5 stickers about 2 months ago and they still haven't came in.
