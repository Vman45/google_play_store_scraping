I DO understand that gameplay is international so folks from EVERYWHERE are playing, still, why are place names and NAMES, actual people's names, accepted as words, but a word like \"alp\" isn't? As an example, \"voe\", a place name is acceptable as a word, as is \"wonk\"?! Since when?! I KNOW you folks want to make it fun, but if you want players to stay with the game, make the words something you can actually find in the dictionary and NOT have to be consulted constantly because they're place names. Think closer to Scrabble, without infringing on a patent. You have a good game going!! Keep it up!! Make it ð¯!! Edit: SO glad you fixed the # of ads! They're no longer intrusive!

But, the commercial and pop-up ad interruptions can be annoying.  Multiple commercial breaks at random... Not like television - often interrupting in mid scene... Always the same 30 second commercial which you can't skip through... Followed by a pop-up ad, which you can skip through, but if you do, it shows up more often.  Then, you have to click on the movie for it to resume... When it does the picture is fuzzy until it takes time to adjust.  It's a very distracting way to watch a movie or show... But, if you can tolerate the interruptions, it's worth using.  The other drawback for me is the absence of a menu... You can't look up or search for a movie or show, you have to rely on skimming through the selections to find what you want... which is okay, but less convenient.   Full Review"

Was not able to figure out the way to save Scanned Pics in Gallery; mailed the Developer for support. Developer responded promptly and guided me with the steps. Saving to Gallery is quite simple- Can be easily done by exporting the  scan, for which we need to press Save/Send button (button with mail sign and diskette) & selecting the 'Export pages as JPEGs' option.

There are some performance issues which I'm sure the team will be addressing but man, right now, this is scratching that scifi rpg itch perfectly. I have beheld awesomeness, Behold Studios. EDIT: I've played a bit of it now and I think the thing I dislike the most about this game is the jarring shift to 3d in the space battles and the map. I like the idea of space battles, I just feel that maybe some of the characters could gain skills you can use during space battles. The 3d graphics also feel very forced. I was expecting an intensely colorful pixel map of space and I wanted to see how you guys would pull that off. I really hope you can change everything 3d back to pixel art. Everything else is great though, I love the battles and how the limited skill selections force you to properly think your way through a fight. It's just these blasted 3d graphics guys... ugh.

I had fond memories playing this on the PSP and DS back then and being able to experience it again on my android after it's been on iOS for so long is an absolute delight. However the controls feel about stiff and wonky, it's not game breaking but coming from the DS stylus and PSP analog stick, I have to say it's not as fluid on my Z3 Compact. The game however hasn't changed and the gaming experience is great. Smooth buttery framerates no hitches and stutters and loading times are good. Only gripe about the game play is that it won't play in full screen. I get this weird sort of 4:3 aspect ratio during gameplay. Hopefully it will be patched out.

I have found FL mobile doesn't replace using FL Studio full version, but sometimes I'm not near my laptop and am not ready to open up my computer and get in to a fully committed project, this is where I value FL Mobile. If you already use FL Studio then there shouldn't be any real learning curve, not to suggest it operates exactly like FL Studio, but after using FL Studio than FL mobile is straight forward and makes logical since with little to no learning curve. It holds true to Image-lines the fastest way from your brain to your speakers. It loads MIDI clips, records playing, records vocals, automation. It has synths & FX. Use or create drum kits with provided wavs or your own wavs. Load wav audio clips. I've tested other mobile DAW type apps and FL mobile is by far the best on Android!!! Also I have used it to record vocals which I will save to my cloud and then open up in a project on FL Studio on my computer. I love it!!! Although I do not view it the same as FL Studio on my computer it is perfectly capable of creating full songs!!! Also if your phone allows you to cast then you can cast to your TV, if no headphones than it's better than phone speakers!! Put it this way you could record any sound anywhere at anytime and incorporate it into a project think of all the possibilities they're infinte!!!!   Full Review"

But as soon as I got Android version (about a week ago I think x.x) and I feel that it's a lot better that people looking for a DAW on mobile devices to create music I recommend this app on Android. You won't regret it cause unlike iOS you can literally do so much on Android than on iOS version.

The first 50 levels show obvious balance with the currebt weapons and upgrades that allowed for a heavy dent in bloon numbers in each stage. They could be used to achieve diamonds without the need of boosts, in mosts cases, with said boosts easing the difficulty.  Now, without boosts, the best you'll see is a silver, gold if you try hard enough. NK is intent on selling their boost crates, Blop Magnets, and Supercharges, if not also the Blops themselves. I've maxed weapons and research and I struggle to even peak silver, and I'm forced to boost on boss stages. I deleted my positive review to put this one down. It's a long term investment of a game that'll make you weary, despite felling like a satisfying purchase in the beginning.   Full Review"

Now the app only records my own voice if I'm using a handsfree device (via headphone jack or bluetooth). If I'm not using a handsfree device, it MIGHT record the other caller, but the voice of the other caller is too low to even hear... If I'm in speaker phone and muted, the recording will just be silent.... overall dissatisfied with the downgrade. I've only kept this app in hopes a fix will come that will make it great again...

        "text": "Could be better  [SPOILERS] The First 2 FNaF games were perfect, and top notch!  While this one is.. kind of a downgrade. The only scary jumpscares are the phantom animatronics. While Springtraps Jumpscare is only made me jump once. In the PC version of this game,  he has two Jumpscares, both are disappointing. The game has NO instructions,  it assumes you already know how to play. BUT, when you  learn how to, it is pretty easy-to-use.  I suggest you get the PC version of this game. THE END   Full Review"

I purchased the game years ago on my Galaxy S3.  I later got an S4 and now have an S5, and I downloaded it to each phone and finished the game 100% each time.  It's a great game, very fun and challenging at times as well.  You can get stuck on a level for quite a while sometimes.  Definitely worth getting!  Also, here's a helpful tip: pay attention to the names of the levels.  They're often a hint on how to beat them!   Full Review"

Then my son decided he wanted to get it and he's too young to play it by himself so he kept asking me for help on the hard levels. Instantly I was hooked. Is is a cute puzzle game that is genuinely fun to play. I didn't think twice about spending the two bucks on it. I'm hooked and am glad that my son was adventurous enough to discover it.  10/10   Full Review"

However there are two main points against this game:   1) It's not hard enough, though I hope the hard mode to be challenging.  2) The score system gives a malus of -100 for every move made during a game. This is too low! It should be at least -300, so that the highest scores in the world wouldn't be from people with plenty of time to lurk on a level, just avoiding to complete it increase the score!
